# California Housing Prediction via ML

Welcome to the California Housing Prediction project! This project aims to predict housing prices in California using machine learning techniques.

## Scope

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the median house value for different districts in California based on various demographic and economic factors.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize a dataset containing various features such as median income, house age, average number of rooms, etc., to predict the median house value.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset obtained from the StatLib repository. It contains 20,640 instances with 8 numeric, predictive attributes and the target variable, which is the median house value for California districts.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Streamlit

## Project Files

- `California_House_Prediction_through_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.
- `housing.csv`: Dataset file.
- `regmodel.pkl`: Pickled regression model.
