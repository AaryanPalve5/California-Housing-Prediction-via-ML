## Scope

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the median house value for different districts in California based on various demographic and economic factors.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize a dataset containing various features such as median income, house age, average number of rooms, etc., to predict the median house value.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset obtained from the StatLib repository. It contains 20,640 instances with 8 numeric, predictive attributes and the target variable, which is the median house value for California districts.
